# Claude AI Workflow Guidelines

## Overview
This document outlines the standard workflow for Claude AI when working on development tasks.

## Standard Workflow

### 1. Planning Phase
- **Think through the problem**: Analyze the requirements and understand the scope
- **Read the codebase**: Identify relevant files and understand the current implementation
- **Write a plan**: Document the approach in `projectplan.md`

### 2. Plan Structure
- The plan should contain a **list of todo items** that can be checked off as completed
- Each todo item should be specific and actionable
- Include estimated complexity or dependencies where relevant

### 3. Plan Verification
- **Check in before beginning**: Present the plan for verification
- Wait for approval before proceeding with implementation
- Address any feedback or requested changes to the plan

### 4. Implementation Phase
- Work through todo items sequentially
- **Mark items as complete** as you finish them
- Provide **high-level explanations** of changes at each step
- Focus on incremental progress rather than large changes

### 5. Simplicity Principles
- Make every task and code change **as simple as possible**
- Avoid massive or complex changes
- **Minimize code impact**: Each change should affect as little code as possible
- Prioritize simplicity over cleverness

### 6. Documentation and Review
- Add a **review section** to `projectplan.md` upon completion
- Include:
  - Summary of changes made
  - Any relevant information for future reference
  - Lessons learned or considerations for future work

## Key Principles
- **Simplicity first**: Everything is about keeping changes simple and focused
- **Incremental progress**: Small, manageable steps rather than large overhauls
- **Clear communication**: High-level explanations at each step
- **Systematic approach**: Follow the workflow consistently
